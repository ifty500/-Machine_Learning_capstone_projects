    "Grading a multiple choice exam is easy. But how much do multiple choice exams tell us about what a student really knows? Dr. Dirac is administering a statistics midterm exam and wants to use Bayesâ€™ Theorem to help him understand the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that a student answered a question correctly, what is the probability that she really knows the material?\n",
    "Dr. Dirac knows the following probabilities based on many years of teaching:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a question on the exam that 60% of students know the correct answer to.\n",
    "Given that a student knows the correct answer, there is still a 15% chance that the student picked the wrong answer.\n",
    "Given that a student does not know the answer, there is still a 20% chance that the student picks the correct answer by guessing.\n",
    "Using these probabilities, we can answer the question."
